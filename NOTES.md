# neural-salsa — research notes

Goal: predict the salsa **1** and **5** counts from audio (spectrogram in,
timestamps out). Secondary goal: learn NN training and interpretability on a
problem with real musical structure.

## 1. Public datasets

### Salsa (TISMIR 2024) — the closest thing that exists
124 songs, 9h52m, 49,433 beats. Three expert annotators per song (music
students at Universidad Icesi, Cali; mean 7 yrs studying salsa), consolidated
with precision-weighted KDE plus a final expert pass. CC-BY-4.0.

- Paper: https://transactions.ismir.net/articles/10.5334/tismir.183
- Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/13120822
- Downloadable: `audio_fragments.zip` (322MB), `mel_spectrograms.zip` (36MB),
  `beat_annotations.zip` (176kB), metadata CSV. Full audio on request for
  nonprofit research.

Local copy of the annotations: `data/salsa_ismir/` + `data/salsa_meta.csv`.

**Critical limitation, found by inspecting the files:** beats only. No
downbeats, no clave, no 8-count phase. Each file is a single column of
**milliseconds**, no beat numbers. Measured density is median **90.8 BPM** —
*half* the dancer-count rate (~180). So annotated beats fall on every other
count (1,3,5,7 or 2,4,6,8; which one is unlabeled).

=> gives us the pulse, tells us **nothing** about 1 vs 5.

### Salsa beat tracking is not solved
TCN F-measure on the Salsa set: **0.659 / 0.683**. Compare Ballroom at
0.933–0.956. Only SMC (0.543–0.552) is comparably hard. Syncopation and
polyrhythm break standard trackers, so the pulse stage is real work.

### Pretrained trackers
- **Beat This!** (ISMIR 2024, CPJKU) — SOTA, joint beat+downbeat, no DBN
  postprocessing, handles tempo variation. Best starting point.
  https://github.com/CPJKU/beat_this
- **Beat Transformer** — has a tempo head.
- **madmom** `DBNBeatTracker` — older baseline. Note `max_bpm=215` default,
  which is *below* some salsa tempos at the dancer-count rate.

## 2. Strategy

No public dataset found that distinguishes the 1 from the 5. The structural
reason: the salsa 8-count spans **two** bars of 4/4. A downbeat tracker
resolves bar-level phase, i.e. "this is a 1 *or* a 5" — the bar-parity
question is exactly the one it cannot answer, and exactly the one a dancer
needs. Candombe has real downbeats but is a different tradition; Ballroom's
IDs are 4/4 bar positions.

So, two stages:

**Stage A — pulse.** Fine-tune/evaluate on the ISMIR Salsa set. Mind the
half-rate annotation.

**Stage B — phase.** Classify 8-count position on top of the grid. Our 1/5
labels come from a subscription source that isn't redistributable, so that
tooling is kept out of this repo.

Decoding for Stage B is unusually well-conditioned. Given a beat grid, phase
advances deterministically (p -> p+1 mod 8), so an HMM over 8 states has all
its uncertainty in the initial state — the decode collapses to 8 sums, one
per candidate offset. Add rare phase resets (real songs break phase at
bridges) and it becomes a genuine HMM with near-deterministic transitions;
then Viterbi for the path, forward-backward for per-beat confidence.

**Interpretability hook:** the cue for phase is nameable — clave direction,
bass tumbao, conga slap placement. "Did it learn the clave?" is an
investigable question.

## 3. Reference notes

### Shift-tolerant loss (Beat This!, ISMIR 2024)
Model runs at 50 fps (22.05 kHz, hop 441, 128 mels, 30 Hz–10 kHz). Targets are
delta spikes; plain BCE penalizes a 20 ms miss as hard as a total miss, while
the F-measure accepts ±70 ms. That mismatch both starves the gradient and
pushes the model to smear probability — producing exactly the blurry
activations that need a DBN to clean up.

Their fix, instead of target widening:

  L = -Σ_t [ w·y_t·log m₇(ŷ)_t + (1 - m₁₃(y)_t)·log(1 - m₇(ŷ)_t) ]

- `m₇(ŷ)` — max-pool *predictions* over 7 frames (±3 = ±60 ms). Fire anywhere
  in the window and you're not penalized. Sized to the ±70 ms eval tolerance.
- `m₁₃(y)` — max-pool *targets* over 13 frames (±6) to mask the negative term.
  A dead zone, wider than the positive window because a prediction 3 frames
  out spreads 3 more under max-pooling.

The target stays sharp, so the model is forgiven for being slightly off but
never told a blob is correct. General principle: when the loss is stricter
than the metric, you pay in both trainability and hedged predictions.

### DBN vs HMM
An HMM *is* a DBN — the simplest member. HMM: one discrete hidden variable per
timestep, Markov transitions, emissions. DBN: a Bayesian network unrolled over
time, whose hidden state may be **factored** into several variables.

Beat tracking's bar-pointer model factors state into (phase, tempo). But any
factored DBN flattens to an equivalent HMM over the Cartesian product of its
variables — which is exactly what Krebs, Böck & Widmer (2015) did, and why
madmom's docs mention a "more efficient version." **What runs inside
`DBNBeatTrackingProcessor` is mechanically a large sparse HMM.** Read "DBN"
here as "HMM over phase × tempo".

Why the DBN can hurt: the tempo prior is global and Viterbi commits to one
hypothesis for the whole track. Octave errors (half/double tempo) get locked
in confidently; tempo variation fights the prior; and if activations are
already clean, the DBN mostly contributes its own biases. The SMC failure-mode
analysis reports that routing Beat This activations through madmom's DBN
worsened 127 of 217 tracks, improved 62, left 28 unchanged.
